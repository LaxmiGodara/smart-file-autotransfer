# Sprint 1 Review: Smart File AutoTransfer System - Upload Module

## Sprint Goal
- Develop the Upload Excel File module  
- Enable users to upload Excel mark sheets and receive proper feedback on the upload process

## User Acceptance Points
1. Users must be able to successfully upload the Excel file.  
2. Users should receive clear feedback indicating whether all rows were updated properly or if any rows failed and why.

## QA/Business Analyst Perspective
- Functionality met: Users can upload Excel mark sheets and get feedback on success or failure.  
- Improvement needed: Feedback should be more detailed and specific for failed uploads instead of generic messages.

## Developer Perspective
- Current status: The module works as intended.  
- Improvement needed: Code reviews should happen more frequently (every three days) instead of once per sprint.  
- UI enhancement: Shift from basic CSS to Tailwind CSS in upcoming sprints for improved styling.
